## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very pale cyan (#F0F8FA), so the primary can stand out from a bright, airy background.
- Accent color: Desaturated violet (#89609E) as a tertiary contrasting color that evokes organization, categorization and industry.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and accessible feel in both headlines and body.
- Use flat, line-based icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic. Icons related to recycling and electronics are useful.
- A clean, grid-based layout to ensure readability and visual appeal on all devices. Use white space to separate sections and guide the user's eye.
- Subtle transitions and animations for claiming listings or confirming pickups. Animation should enhance the user experience without being distracting.
